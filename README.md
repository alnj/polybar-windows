# Script: polywins
A [Polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) script forked from [polybar-windows](https://github.com/aroma1994/polybar-windows) with additional features.
* Left click: Focus window and raise it if it is minimized. If the window is already focused, minimize it.
* Middle click: Close the window.
* Right click: Select a rectangle for the window to be re-positioned to.
* Mouse wheel: Resize the window incrementally.

<sub>For a very limited multihead implementation, check out the [multihead branch](https://github.com/alnj/polywins/tree/multihead).</sub>
